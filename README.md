## 📘 Abstract

This study investigates the **Dragon Portfolio** as a post-COVID alternative to traditional portfolio strategies, particularly the 60/40 stock-bond split. Inspired by Artemis Capital's *“The Allegory of the Hawk and the Serpent”*, the Dragon Portfolio is designed to be resilient across all macroeconomic regimes by balancing exposures in equities, bonds, gold, commodities, and long-volatility strategies.

Using accessible financial indices, we reconstruct and compare:
- The complete Dragon Portfolio
- A standard 60/40 portfolio
- Two Dragon variants (excluding either gold or commodities)

Findings show that **the Dragon Portfolio consistently outperforms**, especially on risk-adjusted metrics, in today's volatile environment.

## 📌 Key Questions

- Has the Dragon Portfolio outperformed traditional strategies since 2020?
- How critical are gold and commodity trend-following in this framework?
- Can the Dragon structure provide a practical blueprint for portfolio resilience?

## 📊 Results Summary

| Portfolio                     | Sharpe Ratio | Max Drawdown | Volatility | Annualized Return |
|------------------------------|--------------|--------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Dragon Portfolio**         | **1.23**     | **-2.80%**   | **5.78%**  | **9.85%**         |
| Dragon w/o Gold              | 1.05         | -3.42%       | 5.60%      | 8.42%             |

- The **full Dragon Portfolio outperforms all variants**, with the best return-to-risk efficiency.
- Removing **commodity trend-following** has the most negative impact.
- Gold contributes defensively, but **trend-following adds convexity** and adaptability.

## 🔍 Limitations & Future Work

- **Index Proxies**: Due to the deprecation of original indices (e.g., HFRX, Eurekahedge), proxy indices were used, which may not fully replicate original strategies.
- **Retail Accessibility**: Implementing the Dragon Portfolio may pose **liquidity, cost, and transparency issues** for individual investors.
- **Backtesting Scope**: This analysis focuses on 2020–2025. Broader backtests could reinforce findings across diverse economic cycles.
